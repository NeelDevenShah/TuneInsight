You played for me, you played for me you played for me I swear even in my sleep I hear it like the memory of everything we used to be. You played for me. We couldn't stop the world from turning. It was like a whirlwind scattered us like this but I'm stuck inside a feeling, a song that never leaves we were like a symphony you played for me, you played for me you pray for me I sleep in my sleep I hear like the memory of everything we used to be. You played for me. I think Eurodance was the track I listened to the most when I was younger. How's it going? It's gonna be good.

s-020,Castles glitter under spanish skies. But I'm just looking out for you tonight. We used to run around this coast town. Always thinking out loud how we gonna get out? I remember we dreamed of places that we could go. Castles with the strange loam people that we don't know. I remember we left a life that sword and Mary from the start we look for stranger things. Cause that's just who we are. Find me the edge of something beautiful and loud. Like I'm picturing now. Castles glitter under spanish skies. But I'm just looking out for you tonight. Snow white Mountain state. Tell me it's all never good. I see a technicolor shadow underneath your window. Just in case you don't know I can see it. You cast an unfamiliar day glow. Different than what I know. Shining like a halo. I can feel it. We turned our back on ordinary from the star. We look for stranger things. Cause that's just who we are. Found me the edge of something beautiful. Aloud. Show me the sky falling down. Cause I'm skinny under stylish skies. But I'm just looking out for you tonight. Snow white matters in ancient place. Tell me somewhere castles glitter. I will be there.,Kygo - Stranger Things ft. OneRepublic (Alan Walker Remix)
